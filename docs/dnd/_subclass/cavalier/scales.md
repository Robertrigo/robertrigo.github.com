  Truth is the most sacred of all ideals. The order of the scales cavalier safeguards the truth in all its forms, punishing liars, cheaters, and traitors, and never lying or bending the truth himself. The order of the scale cavalier is steadfast and just. He does not bend to lies nor trickery. His devotion to truth is more unshakable than many clergymen's devotion to their gods. His presence fills good men with awe and inspiration, and it brings fear to charlatans.

  Members of this cavalier order serve the cause of legal integrity. Many order of the scales cavaliers track down and apprehend fleeing lawbreakers so that these vagrants may answer for their crimes and make good on their debts. They often serve as judges or stakeholders, and work to ensure that wherever a bargain is made—whether it is monetary, a life debt, or an oath to be upheld—both ends make good on their promises.

  - If a bargain becomes impossible to fulfill, he must satisfactorily compensate all aggrieved or adversely affected parties involved in the bargain. 
  - When serving as a judge or arbiter, the cavalier must make fair, impartial judgments, and if unable to do so, must recuse himself at the earliest possibility. 
  - If authorized to enforce an agreement, the cavalier must wholeheartedly strive to accomplish this, remaining unswayed by threats, bribery, and other deterrents.
