Also, when cast on another target than yourself, the duration is only 10 minutes, and requires concentration. You can cast this spell in a number of different ways:<br>&nbsp; ♦ You subtly change the appearance of the target, making that person more or less attractive. This does not make that person look like someone else. Rather, for the positive version, makes the target’s eyes appear to sparkle, their skin clearer and smoother, their teeth straighter and whiter, and their hair thicker and more lustrous; or for the negative version, makes the person seem lackluster and unkempt. While the positive version of this spell is active, the target has advantage on all Charisma ability checks made to illicit a positive reaction. While the negative version of this spell is active, the target has disadvantage on all Charisma ability checks.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You cause the features of the target to blur slightly, obscuring the details of its appearance. Anyone relying on sight has disadvantage on ability checks to recognize or remember the affected creature. The illusion is subtle, so observers are prone to think something is wrong with their eyesight (dust blew into their eyes, or their eyes are watering) rather than that the creature has been masked in any way.<br>&nbsp; ♦ The target blends in with its surroundings. For the duration, that creature may replace its Dexterity (Stealth) modifier with your spell attack bonus on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You make the target, including clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings, to look different until the spell ends or until it use an action to dismiss it. It can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.<p><b>Empowered casting:</b><br>By spending a second level (or higher) spell slot you can create one of the following effects:<br>&nbsp; ♦ By increasing the spell slot level by 1, you can increase the duration to 1 hour and remove the concentration requirement, even when targeting another creature.<br>&nbsp; ♦ By increasing the spell slot level by 2, you can target up to 12 people with the spell.<br>&nbsp; ♦ If you cast this spell using an 5th level spell slot, you can increase the duration to 8 hours, remove concentration and target any number of creatures that you can see within range."

If you do, each creature on the ground except you that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken. Also, at the end of each creature's turn and when trying to get up from a prone position, it must repeat the Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.<br>&nbsp; ♦ If you cast at level 8 or higher, the spell has additional effects.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Fissures.</b> Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below). <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Structures. </b>The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried."

When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 ft radius.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.<br>&nbsp; The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.<br>&nbsp; The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.<br>&nbsp; While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.<br>&nbsp; An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."

A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.<br>&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.<br>&nbsp; After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

This transfer can be to any corporeal humanoid-shaped undead being of CR 3 or less. The undead being thus inhabited loses all control of its actions.<br>&nbsp;The spellcaster's mind functions in two places simultaneously. First, it functions within its own body, where it can sense its surroundings (see, hear, feel, smell, etc...) exactly as before, even benefitting from any spell or magic item enhancements or protections on its body. However, this body is paralyzed, and aside from breathing, blinking, and moving their eyes, the spellcaster cannot move their body while possessing the undead host. Even if its concentration is broken, it will take 1 round for the spellcaster's life force to return to its body. As a result, it is a wise precaution to protect the physical body with guards, wards, or secrecy while so indisposed, or else the life force could return to a beheaded body.<br>&nbsp;Second, the spellcaster's mind functions within the body of the undead host. The spellcaster may will the undead body to move and complete actions as though he were there, but the undead body does not benefit from any items or protections on the spellcaster's body. The undead body loses its normal immunities versus being charmed if the spellcaster himself is not immune to such. The undead host is also vulnerable to illusions and life drain attacks as if they were the spellcaster.<br>&nbsp;While inhabiting the undead body, the spellcaster's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though they retain their own alignment and their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Scores. The spellcaster retains the retains the benefits of their own class features. If the undead that is being inhabited is destroyed, the spellcaster is safely returned to their own body the following round. Being forciby returned to their body does cause a toll upon the caster however, and they may not cast this spell again foranother 24 hours. If the spellcaster returns willingly or due to loss of concentration or the spell simply timing out, the undead host simply takes control of its body again."

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.<br>&nbsp; The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.<br>&nbsp; Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:<br><br>&nbsp; • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoc­cupied space you can see on the ground.<br>&nbsp; • You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.<br>&nbsp; • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis­ tance to a damage type you choose.<br>&nbsp; • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your com­panions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.<br>&nbsp; • You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.<br><br>&nbsp; You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.<br>&nbsp; The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress."
