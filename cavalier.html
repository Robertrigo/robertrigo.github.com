    <h1>Cavalier</h1>
    <p class="phb">While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat, and are often found charging across a battlefield. Usually born to nobility and raised in a royal court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging witty repartee at a state dinner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.</p>

  <div id="Challenge" class="collapse features"><h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>As a action, you can challenge a foe who can see, hear and understand you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you for 1 minute. The effect also ends if you attack any other creature besides the target or if you are rendered unconscious.</p>
    
    <p>Your melee attacks deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier against the target of your challenge. Some cavalier orders grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the order description.</p>
    
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 5th level and three times between rests starting at 13th level.</p>
  </div>  
    
  <div id="MountedExpert" class="collapse features"><h4>Mounted Expert</h4>    
    <p>Your mounted training allows you to effectively control a mount in the chaos of battle. This grants you several benefits.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.</li>
    <li>If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.</li>
    <li>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Steed</h5>
    <p>You may select a mount that becomes your Steed. It uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a steed also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. For each level you gain after 2nd, your steed gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>

    <p>The Steed obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can command the steed where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</p>

    <p>If your steed dies or is otherwise lost, you can obtain another one by spending 1 week bonding with another mount.</p>

    <h5>Superiority Dice</h5>
    <p>While mounted, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

    <h5>Using Superiority Dice</h5>      
    <p>You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Cavalry Charge.</strong> When you ride your mount at least 20 feet and make an attack with a lance or spear, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, if the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed at a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
    <li><strong>Control Mount.</strong> When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.</li>
    <li><strong>Evasive Maneuvers.</strong> If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount's AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount have resistance to the attack's damage.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div id="SecondWind" class="collapse features"><h4>Second Wind</h4>
    <p>From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain a number of hit points based on your cavalier class level.</p>
    
    <table class="table">

    Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
    
  </div>  
  <div id="Order" class="collapse features"><h4>Order</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you must pledge yourself to a specific order. The order grants a number of bonuses, class skills and traits, and are detailed under the section "Orders" below. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that you must follow. If you violate any of these edicts, you loses the benefits from the order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.</p>
    
    <p>Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.</p>
    
  </div>  
  <div id="ActionSurge" class="collapse features"><h4>Action Surge</h4>
    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

    <p>Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>
    
  </div>  
  <div id="AbilityScoreImprovement" class="collapse features"><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
    <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
  </div>  
    
  <div id="ExtraAttack" class="collapse features"><h4>Extra Attack</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

    <p>The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</p>
  </div>  
    
  <div id="FerociousCharger" class="collapse features"><h4>Ferocious Charger</h4>
    <p>At 7th level, you gain additional benefits when you using the cavalry charge maneuver. You can expend up to two superiority dice on the attack, adding both to the damage roll. If you spend two dice, the target has disadvantage on its Strength saving throw and is knocked 15 ft on failure.</p>

    <p>Also, you gain one additional superiority die.</p>
  </div>  
    
  <div id="Indomitable" class="collapse features"><h4>Indomitable</h4>
    <p>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p>
  </div>  
    
  <div id="MountedSuperiority" class="collapse features"><h4>Mounted Superiority</h4>
    <p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s.</p>
    <p>At 18th level, they turn into d12s, and you gain one additional superiority die.</p>

  <div id="BlueRose" class="archetype" hidden><h3>Order of the Blue Rose</h3>
    <p>The cavaliers of the order of the blue rose dedicate themselves to promoting peace in the lands they roam. Skilled warriors and adept diplomats, these cavaliers counsel wisdom, patience, and understanding, but are ever mindful of the need to take up arms to strike down aggressors, tyrants, or evil usurpers. Although they believe wholeheartedly in peace as an aim and a final goal, cavaliers of the blue rose are warriors first, and embrace their role as guardians of those who cannot or will not take up arms to defend themselves.</p>
    
    <h4>Edicts</h4>
    Cavaliers of the Blue Rose share the following edicts.
    <ul>
      <li>The cavalier must guard against needless violence, protecting both the land and its people from wars they neither started nor wish to fight.</li>
      <li>He must seek to stop conflict with a minimum of bloodshed, to encourage peaceful resolutions to disagreements between intelligent creatures, and to mend the wounds opened by battle.</li>
      <li>He must also honor quarter when he gives it, protecting captives who have surrendered from his own allies if need be.</li>
    </ul>      
      
    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>Whenever you issue a challenge, you receive a +1d4 bonus on attack rolls made against the target of your challenge, if the target is an intelligent creature to whom you offered the chance to surrender (by taking an action to offer terms).</p>
    <p>At 18th level, you have advantage on attack rolls against that target as well.</p>

    <h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
    <p>You gain proficiency in the History skill.</p>
    <p>Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check to mediate a dispute between two parties that do not include you, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>
    
    <h4>Flat of the Blade</h4>
    <p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to moderate your attacks in order to take an enemy alive. You take any penalties for attempting to subdue an opponent. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to instead leave the creature at 1 hit point.</p>
    <p>The creature is frightened of you for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. It must also make a Charisma saving throw with a DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier. If the creature fails this saving throw, it answers truthfully any questions you ask it and obeys your direct orders while it is frightened by this effect.</p>
    <p>When you make use of this ability on a foe dealing lethal damage, or allowing your allies to kill the target, is considered a violation of your edicts. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>

    <h4>Calming Them Down</h4>
    <p>From 10th level, you can duplicate the effects of the <em>calm emotions</em> spell. Use the result of a Charisma (Persuasion) check as the DC. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>You have learned that while not all things in the world will go as you wish, you must remain calm and centered.</p>
    <p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
