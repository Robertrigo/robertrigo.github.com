title: Inquisitor
def: an

desc: |
  Most people of the world are familiar with clerics; the healers and preachers who spread the word of the Gods. Most also are familiar with paladins, who uphold virtuous principles and protect the meek. Inquisitors, while undoubtedly devoted to their god, is neither of these. Inquisitors are holy hunters; they seek to strike out into the world and unleash the wrath of their god upon those who defy them.
  
  #### Answers only to their deity
  The inquisitor is in many ways similar to the paladin, but where the paladin serves his cause by being a shining example for others, the inquisitor work in the shadows, doing the dirty work that is necessary. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals. An inquisitor is not always the follower that the church wants, but the follower that the church needs.
  
  Each inquisitor has different goals, largely based on their god and their god's desires. An inquisitor of Pelor, for example, may seek out and destroy undead, while and inquisitor of Silvanus may hunt those who would harm or destroy nature. All inquisitors have a divine mission.

##### Blessed Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from a cleric spell list appropriate to your deity. They count as Inquisitor spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the same spell list.
___
Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Judgement
As an instrument of your deity's will, you are empowered to pass judgment on those around you. You learn two judgement of your choice, which are detailed under "Judgements" below. You learn one additional judgement of your choice at 7th, 11th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new judgements, you can also replace one judgement you know with a different one.
___
As a bonus action, you may direct your righteous fury at any creature within 60 feet by pointing your finger at them and judge them with one of your known judgements.
___
Unless otherwise stated, effects last for 1 minute. If the target of your judgment dies or enters a different plane of existence before the duration has elapsed, as a bonus action, you may shift your judgment to another creature within range for the remainder of the duration. 
___
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. In addition, you can expend a spell slot to use this feature. The spell slot must be the highest currently available to you.

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.
___
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your action to open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher** At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the paladin spell list. The Spells Known column of the inquisitor table shows when you learn more spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the paladin spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your inquisitor spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a inquisitor spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
___

You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your inquisitor spells.

You can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start the examination within 1 round after you experienced the spell's effect. Instead of locating a known creature, you locate the caster of the spell effect or magic item you examined.

#### Spell Aegis
At 11th level, you gain advantage against any spell targeting against you.

#### Devourer of Magic

If you do not have spell slots of that level at the moment, you cannot use this ability. Succeeding at the saving throw does not mean the spell has no effect.

\page

### Judgements

#### Brand the Faithless
You can sear a message in the flesh of the judged creature with a touch. Make a melee spell attack roll. On a hit, the creature takes 1d4 + Wisdom modifier fire damage and is branded with a small symbol or short word. This marks it and professes its sin outwardly to the world, though the brand may be concealed (by clothing, etc.). The creature may take 1d6 damage to scrape the outward sign of the brand off, but it returns if they regain any hit points. The brand persists for 36 hours and can only be removed early by a *remove curse* spell or if you use this feature on another creature.

You may spend 10 minutes in meditation to determine the approximate direction of the creature as long as the brand persists and you are within 5 miles of it. If you detect the creature in this manner after 24 hours have elapsed, you may attempt to renew the brand. The creature becomes acutely aware of your intent to rebrand it, and makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success, the brand remains until its time has elapsed, but you cannot make another attempt to brand it remotely. On a failure, the creature takes 1 fire damage and is branded for an additional 36 hours, and may be branded in this manner again after 24 hours.

* **Greater Brand the Faithless**. You can apply the brand in an painless manner, allowing you to brand your target without it knowing.

#### Destruction
You are filled with divine wrath against this creature. On a melee or ranged hit, you deal additional 1d6 radiant damage to that creature.

* **Greater Destruction**. Damage increases to 2d6. 

#### Fear of God
If the judged creature fails a Wisdom save against your inquisitor spell save DC, it is frightened for the duration of the judgement. The target may attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

* **Greater Fear of God**. All creatures within 30 ft that can see and hear you are affected by this judgement.

#### Healing
Whenever the judged creature deals damage to you, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received. These hit points remain until the end of the creature's next turn.

* **Greater Healing**. You can use your action to heal an amount of hit points equal to half the temporary hit points you have received from this judgement and currently have left. This expends all temporary hit points.

#### No one expects the inquisition
Gain advantage on Stealth and Deception checks against the target, and if you act in the surprise round you have an advantage on attack rolls against the target as long as the surprise round last, in addition if you score a hit against the target during the surprised round, it is a considered a critical hit.

* **Greater No One Expects the Inquisition**. You gain the bonuses from this judgement against all creatures.

```
```

#### Piercing
This judgment gives you great focus and makes your spells more potent. Whenever you target the judged creature with a spell, or the creature is affected by an area spell effect by a spell cast by you, it has disadvantage on saves against those spells.

* **Greater Piercing**. When you deal spell damage to the judged creature, add Wisdom modifier to the damage.

#### Pride
The judged creatures pride shines through and it boastfully opens its guard to you. You may add 1d4 to your attack rolls made against this creature.

* **Greater Pride**.The judged creature's nonchalance against you causes it to have disadvantage on all attacks against you.

#### Protection
You are surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, any critical hit made by the judged creature is considered a normal hit.

* **Greater Protection**. You have advantage on saves against spells cast by the judged creature.

#### Resiliency
This judgment makes you resistant to harm. Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from non magical weapons is reduced by 3.

* **Greater Resiliency**. Damage is reduced even from magical sources.

#### Sloth
Weighed down by their sin, the judged creature's movement speed is reduced by half. 

* **Greater Sloth**. If the target fails a Wisdom save against your spellcasting DC, it has disadvantage on all melee attacks.

#### Smiting
This judgment bathes your weapons in a divine light. When you hit the judged creature, you can expend one inquisitor spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

* **Greater Smiting**. You can smite any target, not just the judged creature.
