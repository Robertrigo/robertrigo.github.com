<h1>Cavalier</h1>
<p class="phb"><p>While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat, and are often found charging across a battlefield. Usually born to nobility and raised in a royal court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging witty repartee at a state dinner. The cavalier’s true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.</p>

  <div id="Challenge" class="collapse features"><h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>As a action, you can challenge a foe who can see, hear and understand you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you for 1 minute. The effect also ends if you attack any other creature besides the target or if you are rendered unconscious.</p>

<p>Your melee attacks deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier against the target of your challenge. Some cavalier orders grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the order description.</p>

<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 5th level and three times between rests starting at 13th level.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="MountedExpert" class="collapse features"><h3>Mounted Expert</h3>
    <p>Your mounted training allows you to effectively control a mount in the chaos of battle. This grants you several benefits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.</li>
  <li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.</li>
  <li>If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.</li>
  <li>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="steed">Steed</h4>
<p>You may select a mount that becomes your Steed. It uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a steed also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. For each level you gain after 2nd, your steed gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>

<p>The Steed obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can command the steed where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</p>

<p>If your steed dies or is otherwise lost, you can obtain another one by spending 1 week bonding with another mount.</p>

<h4 id="superiority-dice">Superiority Dice</h4>
<p>While mounted, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<h4 id="using-superiority-dice">Using Superiority Dice</h4>
<p>You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cavalry Charge</strong>. When you ride your mount at least 20 feet and make an attack with a lance or spear, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, if the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed at a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Mount</strong>. When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong>. If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount’s AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount have resistance to the attack’s damage.</li>
</ul>

  </div>

  <div id="SecondWind" class="collapse features"><h3>Second Wind</h3>
    <p>From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain a number of hit points based on your cavalier class level.</p>

        <p>Whenever you issue a challenge, your allies receive a +1 bonus on all damage rolls against the target of your challenge as long as it is adjacent to you. This bonus increases by +1 at 10th level and again at 15th level.</p>

      <div id="dragonBulwark" class="collapse orderFeatures"><h3>Bulwark</h3>

When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren’t incapacitated, you can choose one ally that also failed its saving throw against the same effect.

The order of the scales cavalier safeguards the truth in all its forms, punishing liars, cheaters, and traitors, and never lying or bending the truth himself. The order of the scale cavalier is steadfast and just. He does not bend to lies nor trickery. His devotion to truth is more unshakable than many clergymen’s devotion to their gods. His presence fills good men with awe and inspiration, and it brings fear to charlatans.</p>

<p>Members of this cavalier order serve the cause of legal integrity. Many order of the scales cavaliers track down and apprehend fleeing lawbreakers so that these vagrants may answer for their crimes and make good on their debts. They often serve as judges or stakeholders, and work to ensure that wherever a bargain is made—whether it is monetary, a life debt, or an oath to be upheld—both ends make good on their promises.</p>

<h3 id="edicts">Edicts</h3>
<p>Cavaliers of the Scales share the following edicts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cavalier is not allowed to deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, stating half-truths with the intent to deceive, exaggerating, telling white lies, and so on.</li>
  <li>The cavalier must fulfill all binding agreements he makes.</li>
  <li>If a bargain becomes impossible to fulfill, he must satisfactorily compensate all aggrieved or adversely affected parties involved in the bargain.</li>
  <li>When serving as a judge or arbiter, the cavalier must make fair, impartial judgments, and if unable to do so, must recuse himself at the earliest possibility.</li>
  <li>If authorized to enforce an agreement, the cavalier must wholeheartedly strive to accomplish this, remaining unswayed by threats, bribery, and other deterrents.</li>
