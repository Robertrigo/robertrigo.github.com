<h5 id="blessed-warrior">Blessed Warrior</h5>

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the same spell list.
___
Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.</p>

<p>As an instrument of your deity‚Äôs will, you are empowered to pass judgment on those around you. You learn two judgement of your choice, which are detailed under ‚ÄúJudgements‚Äù below.

<em>__
As a bonus action, you may direct your righteous fury at any creature within 60 feet by pointing your finger at them and judge them with one of your known judgements.
__</em>
Unless otherwise stated, effects last for 1 minute. If the target of your judgment dies or enters a different plane of existence before the duration has elapsed, as a bonus action, you may shift your judgment to another creature within range for the remainder of the duration. 
___

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your action to open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
__</em>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the paladin spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your inquisitor spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a inquisitor spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

<h4 id="judgement-of-vengeance">Judgement of Vengeance</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn the following Judgement option in addition to the ones already known:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Retribution</strong>. Whenever the judged creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
  <li><strong>Greater Retribution</strong>. You can can use your reaction to make an attack against the judged creature when it attacks you.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="agonizing-rebuke">Agonizing Rebuke</h4>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you may rebuke a creature that harms you. When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

<h4 id="fear-the-flames">Fear the Flames</h4>
<p>At 11th level, you can give a creature you can see within 60 feet one chance to avoid an eternity of suffering by ordering it to carry out any one simple action that would take no more than 1 round to complete, as the <em>command</em> spell. If it does not comply, an illusory fiend is called forth to drag the creature into an afterlife of pain and misery. This otherwise acts identically to <em>phantasmal killer</em> spell. Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<h4 id="final-vengeance">Final Vengeance</h4>
<p>From 18th level, as a reaction when reduced to 0 hp, you may perform any action. If the action is an attack against a creature that caused you to be reduced to 0 hp, any attack that hit it are considered critical hits.</p>

<h4 id="disrupt">Disrupt</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, if you have an active Judgment and you hit an enemy who is at the moment concentrating on a spell, you deal an additional 1d4 radiant damage for each level of the spell he is trying to concentrate on.</p>

<h4 id="spell-scent">Spell Scent</h4>
<p>At 7th level, you learn how to sense unique spell signatures, and can follow the trail of a cast spell or spell effect cast back to its source. When you come into contact with or are exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, you can spend an action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gain the effect of a locate creature spell. You can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start the examination within 1 round after you experienced the spell‚Äôs effect. Instead of locating a known creature, you locate the caster of the spell effect or magic item you examined.</p>

<h4 id="spell-aegis">Spell Aegis</h4>
<p>At 11th level, you gain advantage against any spell targeting against you.</p>

<h4 id="devourer-of-magic">Devourer of Magic</h4>
<p>At 18th level, when you are the target of a hostile or offensive spell of 5th level or lower and you succeed on your saving throw, you may use your reaction and spend a spell level of the same spell level used, to copy and recast that spell against the original caster. Also, you learn that spell on your list as if it was an Inquisitor spell off the same level. This learned spell will vanish after a period of 24 hours. If you do not have spell slots of that level at the moment, you cannot use this ability. Succeeding at the saving throw does not mean the spell has no effect.</p>

<h3 id="judgements">Judgements</h3>

<h4 id="brand-the-faithless">Brand the Faithless</h4>
<p>You can sear a message in the flesh of the judged creature with a touch. Make a melee spell attack roll. On a hit, the creature takes 1d4 + Wisdom modifier fire damage and is branded with a small symbol or short word. This marks it and professes its sin outwardly to the world, though the brand may be concealed (by clothing, etc.). The creature may take 1d6 damage to scrape the outward sign of the brand off, but it returns if they regain any hit points. The brand persists for 36 hours and can only be removed early by a <em>remove curse</em> spell or if you use this feature on another creature.</p>

<p>You may spend 10 minutes in meditation to determine the approximate direction of the creature as long as the brand persists and you are within 5 miles of it. If you detect the creature in this manner after 24 hours have elapsed, you may attempt to renew the brand. The creature becomes acutely aware of your intent to rebrand it, and makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success, the brand remains until its time has elapsed, but you cannot make another attempt to brand it remotely. On a failure, the creature takes 1 fire damage and is branded for an additional 36 hours, and may be branded in this manner again after 24 hours.</p>

  <li><strong>Greater Brand the Faithless</strong>. You can apply the brand in an painless manner, allowing you to brand your target without it knowing.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="fear-of-god">Fear of God</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Fear of God</strong>. All creatures within 30 ft that can see and hear you are affected by this judgement.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="healing">Healing</h4>
<p>Whenever the judged creature deals damage to you, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received. These hit points remain until the end of the creature‚Äôs next turn.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Healing</strong>. You can use your action to heal an amount of hit points equal to half the temporary hit points you have received from this judgement and currently have left. This expends all temporary hit points.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="no-one-expects-the-inquisition">No one expects the inquisition</h4>
<p>Gain advantage on Stealth and Deception checks against the target, and if you act in the surprise round you have an advantage on attack rolls against the target as long as the surprise round last, in addition if you score a hit against the target during the surprised round, it is a considered a critical hit.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater No One Expects the Inquisition</strong>. You gain the bonuses from this judgement against all creatures.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="piercing">Piercing</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Piercing</strong>. When you deal spell damage to the judged creature, add Wisdom modifier to the damage.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Pride</strong>.The judged creature‚Äôs nonchalance against you causes it to have disadvantage on all attacks against you.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="protection">Protection</h4>
<p>You are surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, any critical hit made by the judged creature is considered a normal hit.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Protection</strong>. You have advantage on saves against spells cast by the judged creature.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resiliency">Resiliency</h4>
<p>This judgment makes you resistant to harm. Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from non magical weapons is reduced by 3.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater Resiliency</strong>. Damage is reduced even from magical sources.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sloth">Sloth</h4>
<p>Weighed down by their sin, the judged creature‚Äôs movement speed is reduced by half.</p>
