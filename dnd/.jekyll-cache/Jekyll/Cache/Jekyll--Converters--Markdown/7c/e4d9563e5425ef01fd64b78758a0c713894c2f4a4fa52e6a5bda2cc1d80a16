I"ü<p>From 15th level, you can formally witness an oath or agreement between two creatures. If either creature breaks or reneges on the agreement and you become aware of this, you gain the bonuses from your Seek Retribution ability against that creature at all times. This ability ends when the creature fulfills the conditions of the oath or receives just punishment for breaking the oath. The maximum number of witnessed oaths you can have active at a time is equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
