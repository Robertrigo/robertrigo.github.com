I"W<p>As a action, you can challenge a foe who can see, hear and understand you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you for 1 minute. The effect also ends if you attack any other creature besides the target or if you are rendered unconscious.</p>

<p>Your melee attacks deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier against the target of your challenge. Some cavalier orders grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the order description.</p>

<p>Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 5th level and three times between rests starting at 13th level.</p>
