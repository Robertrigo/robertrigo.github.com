I"<p>Your mounted training allows you to effectively control a mount in the chaos of battle. This grants you several benefits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.</li>
  <li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.</li>
  <li>If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if youâ€™re not incapacitated.</li>
  <li>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
</ul>
