I"O<p>From 10th level, you swear not to use trickery and deception in combat, and you expect this from others as well. When you are targeted by a spell from a creature not challenged by you, you have advantage on any saving throws against that spell. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>
