I"•<p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you arenâ€™t incapacitated, you can choose one ally that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that ally can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>
