<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>As a action, you can challenge a foe who can see, hear and understand you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you for 1 minute. The effect also ends if you attack any other creature besides the target or if you are rendered unconscious.
  <em>__
Your melee attacks deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier against the target of your challenge. Some cavalier orders grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the order description.
__</em>
Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 5th level and three times between rests starting at 13th level.</p>

<h3 id="mounted-expert">Mounted Expert</h3>
<p>Your mounted training allows you to effectively control a mount in the chaos of battle. This grants you several benefits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.</li>
  <li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.</li>
  <li>If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you‚Äôre not incapacitated.</li>
  <li>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="steed">Steed</h4>
<p>You may select a mount that becomes your Steed. It uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a steed also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. For each level you gain after 2nd, your steed gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
<em>__
The Steed obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn‚Äôt take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can command the steed where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.
__</em>
If your steed dies or is otherwise lost, you can obtain another one by spending 1 week bonding with another mount.</p>

<h4 id="superiority-dice">Superiority Dice</h4>
<p>While mounted, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<h4 id="using-superiority-dice">Using Superiority Dice</h4>
<p>You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cavalry Charge</strong>. When you ride your mount at least 20 feet and make an attack with a lance or spear, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, if the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed at a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Mount</strong>. When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong>. If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount‚Äôs AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount have resistance to the attack‚Äôs damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="second-wind">Second Wind</h3>
<p>From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain a number of hit points based on your cavalier class  level.</p>
