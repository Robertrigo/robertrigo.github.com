I"<p>At 18th level, you can move to intercept foes. When a foe makes an action, as a reaction, you can move up to your speed (or your mount’s speed, if mounted) and make a single melee attack. This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal. You must end your movement adjacent to an enemy. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>
