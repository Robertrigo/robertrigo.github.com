#### Edicts
Cavaliers of the Blue Rose share the following edicts.
- The cavalier must guard against needless violence, protecting both the land and its people from wars they neither started nor wish to fight. 
- He must seek to stop conflict with a minimum of bloodshed, to encourage peaceful resolutions to disagreements between intelligent creatures, and to mend the wounds opened by battle.
- He must also honor quarter when he gives it, protecting captives who have surrendered from his own allies if need be.
