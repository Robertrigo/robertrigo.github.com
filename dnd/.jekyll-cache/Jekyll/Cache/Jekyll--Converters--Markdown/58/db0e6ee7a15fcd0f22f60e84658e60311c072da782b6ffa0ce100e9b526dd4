I"ƒ<p>You become ever more emboldened with each glorious victory. As an bonus action after reducing the target of your challenge to 0 hit points, you can elect to issue a new challenge to an opponent within 20 feet. This challenge does not count against your number of challenges per day. You gain a bonus on melee damage rolls against the target of you challenge equal to 2 times the number of consecutive challenges you have issued so far. As long as you continue to defeat targets and there are more opponents in range, you can continue to issue challenges indefinitely, with the bonus on damage rolls increasing with each subsequent foe.</p>
