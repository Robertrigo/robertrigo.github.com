I"¦<p>At 10th level, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, reduce the creatureâ€™s speed by 20 for the rest of the turn. When you make an opportunity attack, you can make an additional reaction before the end of your next turn. You can make no more reactions between turns than your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You can not benefit from this feature while using the sentinel feat.</p>
