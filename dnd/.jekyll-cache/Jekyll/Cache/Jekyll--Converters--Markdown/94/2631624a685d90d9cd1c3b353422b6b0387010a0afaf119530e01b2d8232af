I"3<p>At 10th level, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 15 feet who can see you. If they fail at a Wisdom save against a DC equal to the result of the Intimidate check, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on all the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>
