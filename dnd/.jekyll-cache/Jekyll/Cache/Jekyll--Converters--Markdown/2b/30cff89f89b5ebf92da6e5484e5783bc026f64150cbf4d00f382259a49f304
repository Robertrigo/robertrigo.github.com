I"#<p>Cavaliers of the Blue Rose share the following edicts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cavalier must guard against needless violence, protecting both the land and its people from wars they neither started nor wish to fight.</li>
  <li>He must seek to stop conflict with a minimum of bloodshed, to encourage peaceful resolutions to disagreements between intelligent creatures, and to mend the wounds opened by battle.</li>
  <li>He must also honor quarter when he gives it, protecting captives who have surrendered from his own allies if need be.</li>
</ul>
