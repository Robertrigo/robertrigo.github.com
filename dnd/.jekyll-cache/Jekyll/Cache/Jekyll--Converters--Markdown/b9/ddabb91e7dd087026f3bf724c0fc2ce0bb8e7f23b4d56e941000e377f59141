Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to instead leave the creature at 1 hit point.</p>

<p>The creature is frightened of you for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. It must also make a Charisma saving throw with a DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier. If the creature fails this saving throw, it answers truthfully any questions you ask it and obeys your direct orders while it is frightened by this effect.</p>
