I"’<p>At 10th level, you can call upon your deity to bolster you in combat. As a bonus action, you can call out the name of your deity, granting a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on all attack and damage rolls to all allies within 30 feet (including yourself). This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
