I"a<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you must pledge yourself to a specific order. The order grants a number of bonuses, class skills and traits, and are detailed under the section “Orders” below. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that you must follow. If you violate any of these edicts, you loses the benefits from the order’s challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.</p>

<p>Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.</p>
