I"¢<p>At 7th level, you can use an action to bolster the resolve of your companions who can see or hear you. These allies gain temporary hit points equal to half your character level + your Charisma modifier. If any of the allies affected is frightened, he can immediately make another saving throw to resist the effect (if allowed). Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>
