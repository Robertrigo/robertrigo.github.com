<div style='margin-top:20px'>  </div><p>Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens.They are descended from beings with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not all aasimar are descended from humans. Aasimar can be born of any intelligent race, though human aasimar are the most common. Aasimar of other races usually exemplify the ideals of beauty and skill as seen by their base race. For example, halfling aasimar are small, beautifully proportioned, and display exceptional grace. Half-orc aasimar are slightly larger and stronger than ordinary orcs, with tough skin and metallic claws and tusks; they are likely to be neutral rather than evil, but still display aggression and incredible combat prowess. Less common humanoids, such as lizardfolk, catfolk, tengus, and others, can also produce aasimar, though given these races&#39; exotic appearance, members of the more common races may have trouble telling such aasimar apart from their kin.</p>
<h3 id="celestial-champions">Celestial Champions</h3>
<p>Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-wanderers">Hidden Wanderers</h3>
<p>While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.</p>
<hr>
<p>When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.</p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre><h3 id="aasimar-guides">Aasimar Guides</h3>
<p>An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. </p>
<hr>
<p>The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.</p>
<hr>
<p>A deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva
might not understand the compromises and hard choices
that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva,
an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high,
sometimes inflexible standards.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character&#39;s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character&#39;s guide.</p>

</div><div class="phb" id="p2" data-reactid="4"><h3 id="conflicted-souls">Conflicted Souls</h3>
<p>Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar&#39;s guide is wise but not infallible.</p>
<h3 id="aasimar-names">Aasimar Names</h3>
<p>Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture. </p>

<h3 id="scourge-aasimar">Scourge Aasimar</h3>
<p>Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them.

<hr>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Constitution score increases by 1.</p>

In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. </p>
<p>Once you use this trait, you can&#39;t use it again until you
finish a long rest.</p>
</div><div class="phb" id="p3" data-reactid="5"><h3 id="fallen-aasimar">Fallen Aasimar</h3>

<hr>
<p><strong>Necrotic Shroud</strong>. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage
equals your level.</p>
