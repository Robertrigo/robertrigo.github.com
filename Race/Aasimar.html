<div style='margin-top:20px'>  </div><p>Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens.They are descended from beings with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not all aasimar are descended from humans. Aasimar can be born of any intelligent race, though human aasimar are the most common. Aasimar of other races usually exemplify the ideals of beauty and skill as seen by their base race. For example, halfling aasimar are small, beautifully proportioned, and display exceptional grace. Half-orc aasimar are slightly larger and stronger than ordinary orcs, with tough skin and metallic claws and tusks; they are likely to be neutral rather than evil, but still display aggression and incredible combat prowess. Less common humanoids, such as lizardfolk, catfolk, tengus, and others, can also produce aasimar, though given these races&#39; exotic appearance, members of the more common races may have trouble telling such aasimar apart from their kin.</p>
<h3 id="celestial-champions">Celestial Champions</h3>
<p>Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-wanderers">Hidden Wanderers</h3>
<p>While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.</p>
<hr>
<p>When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.</p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre><h3 id="aasimar-guides">Aasimar Guides</h3>
<p>An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. </p>
<hr>
<p>The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.</p>
<hr>
<p>A deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva
might not understand the compromises and hard choices
that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva,
an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high,
sometimes inflexible standards.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character&#39;s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character&#39;s guide.</p>

</div><div class="phb" id="p2" data-reactid="4"><h3 id="conflicted-souls">Conflicted Souls</h3>
<p>Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar&#39;s guide is wise but not infallible.</p>
<h3 id="aasimar-names">Aasimar Names</h3>
<p>Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture. </p>
<h2 id="aasimar-racial-traits">Aasimar Racial traits</h2>

<pre><code>
</code></pre><h3 id="protector-aasimar">Protector Aasimar</h3>

<h3 id="scourge-aasimar">Scourge Aasimar</h3>
<p>Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Radiant Consumption</strong>. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you.</p>
<p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. </p>
<p>Once you use this trait, you can&#39;t use it again until you
finish a long rest.</p>
</div><div class="phb" id="p3" data-reactid="5"><h3 id="fallen-aasimar">Fallen Aasimar</h3>

<hr>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Necrotic Shroud</strong>. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage
equals your level.</p>
<p>Once you use this trait, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

Which means you are free to use The Homebrewery is any way that you want, except for claiming that you made it yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to sell or in some way gain profit for what's created on this site, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the proper licenses/rights for any images or resources used.\r\n\r\n### More Resources\r\nIf you are looking for more 5e Homebrew resources check out [r/UnearthedArcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/) and their list of useful resources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3uwxx9/resources_open_to_the_community/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src='http://i.imgur.com/hMna6G0.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:50px;right:30px;width:280px' />\r\n\r\n<div class='pageNumber'>1</div>\r\n<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | FANCINESS</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n# Appendix\r\n\r\n### Not quite Markdown\r\nAlthough the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I've had to include a few new keywords.\r\n\r\n___\r\n* **Horizontal Rules** are generally used to *modify* existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.\r\n* **New Pages** are controlled by the author. It's impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you'd like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.\r\n* **Code Blocks** are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don't allow for styling within them, they weren't that useful to use.\r\n* **HTML** can be used to get *just* the right look for your homebrew. I've included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\nImages must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included 'inline' with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.\r\n\r\nBackground images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you'd like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Crediting Me\r\nIf you'd like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I'd be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='pageNumber'>2</div>\r\n<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | BORING STUFF</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n","changelog":"# changelog\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 03/12/2016 - v2.6.0\r\n- Added report back to the edit page\r\n- Changed metaeditor icon\r\n- Added a button to quickly share your brew to reddit :)\r\n- Disabled Partial Page Rendering unless your brew hits 75 pages or longer\r\n- The brew renderer will now try and use your first page to judge the page size of each of your brews.

The old Class table block used weird stacking of HTML elements, resulting is difficult to control behaviour and poor interactiosn with the rest of the page. This new block is much easier to style and work with.\r\n- Added in a new wide table snippet\r\n- Added in a new auto-incremeting page number snippet (thakns u/Ryrok!)\r\n- Lists in monster stat blocks should be fixed now\r\n\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 04/06/2016 - v2.2.0\r\n- MIgrating The Homebrewery over to hombrewery.naturalcrit.com. It know runs on it's own server, with it's own repo separate from the other tools I'm working on. Makes updating and deploying much easier.\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 29/05/2016 - v2.1.0\r\n- Finally added a syntax for doing spell lists. A bit in-depth about why this took so long. Essentially I'm running out of syntax to use in stardard Markdown. There are too many unique elements in the PHB-style to be mapped. I solved this earlier by stacking certain elements together (eg. an `<hr>` before a `blockquote` turns it into moster state block), but those are getting unweildly. I would like to simply wrap these in `div`s with classes, but unfortunately Markdown stops processing when within HTML blocks. To get around this I wrote my own override to the Markdown parser and lexer to process Markdown within a simple div class wrapper. This should open the door for more unique syntaxes in the future. Big step!\r\n- Override Ctrl+P (and cmd+P) to launch to the print page. Many people try to just print either the editing or share page to get a PDF. While this dones;t make much sense, I do get a ton of issues about it. So now if you try to do this, it'll just bring you imediately to the print page. Everybody wins!\r\n- The onboarding flow has also been confusing a few users (Homepage -> new -> save -> edit page). If you edit the Homepage text now, a Call to Action to save your work will pop-up.\r\n- Added a 'Recently Edited' and 'Recently Viewed' nav item to the edit and share page respectively. Each will remember the last 8 items you edited or viewed and when you viewed it. Makes use of the new title attribute of brews to easy navigatation.\r\n- Paragraphs now indent properly after lists (thanks u/slitjen!)\r\n\r\n### Friday, 27/05/2016 - v2.0.6\r\n- Updated the issue template for (hopefully) better reporting\r\n- Added suggestion to use chrome while PDF printing\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 25/05/2016 -v2.0.5\r\n- The class table generators have the proper ability score improvement progression.\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 24/05/2016 - v2.0.4\r\n- Fixed extra wide monster stat blocks sometimes only being one column\r\n- The class table generators now follow the proper progression from the PHB (thakns u/IrishBandit)\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 19/05/2016 - v2.0.2\r\n\r\n- No longer server-side pre-render brews, just incase the user entered invalid HTML, it might crahsh the server\r\n- Bumped up the allowed entity size for extra-large brew (Thanks for reporting it dickboner93)\r\n- Added a little error box when a save fails with a custom link to reporting the issue on github.\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 14/05/2016 - v2.0.0 (finally!)\r\n\r\nI've been working on v2 for a *very* long time. I want to thank you guys for being paitent.\r\nIt started rather small, but as more and more features were added, I decided to just wait until everything was polished.\r\n\r\nMassive changelog incoming:\r\n\r\n#### Brews\r\n- New flow for creating new brews. Before creating a new brew would immedaitely create a brew in the database and let you edit it. Many people would create a new brew just to experiment and close it, which lead to many \"abandoned brews\" (see the Under the hood section below). This started eating up a ton of database space. You now have to manually save a new brew for the first time, however Homebrewery will store anything you don't have saved in local storage, just in case your browser crashes or whatever, it will load that up when you go back to `/homebrew/new`\r\n- Black blocking edges around notes and stat blocks when printing to PDFs have been fixed\r\n- Borders sometimes not showing up in the second column have been fixed\r\n- All pseudo-element borders have been replaced with reliable border images.\r\n- Chrome can finally print to PDF as good as Chrome Canary! Updating instructions.\r\n- Added a little page number box.\r\n- Added in a new editable Brew Title. This will be shown in the navbar on share pages, and will default to the file name when you save as PDF. All exsisting brews will be defaulted with an empty title.\r\n- Mutliline lists render better now\r\n- Firefox rendering has been slithgly improved. Firefox and Chrome render things **slightly** differently, over the course of a brew, these little changes add up and lead to very noticable rendering differences between the browsers. I'm trying my best to get Firefox rendering better, but it's a difficult problem.\r\n- A bunch of you have wanted to donate to me. I am super flattered by that. I created a [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf). If you feel like helping out, head here :)\r\n\r\n#### Under the Hood Stuff\r\n- Setup a proper staging environment. Will be using this for tests, and hopefully getting the community to help me test future versions\r\n- Server-side prerendering now much faster\r\n- Regular weekly database back-ups. Your brews are safe!\r\n- Database is now uniquely indexed on both editId and shareId, page loads/saving should be much faster\r\n- Improved Admin console. This helps me answer people's questions about issues with their brews\r\n- Added a whole querying/pagniation API that I can use for stats and answering questions\r\n- Clearing out \"Abandoned\" brews (smaller than a tweet and haven't been viewed for a week). These account for nearly a third of all stored brews.\r\n\r\n#### Interface\r\n- Added in a whole new editor with syntax highlighting for markdown\r\n- Built a splitpane! Remembers where you left the split in between sessions\r\n- Re-organized the snippets into a hierarchical groups. Should be much easier to find what you need\r\n- Partial page rendering is working. The Homebrewery will now only load the viewable pages, and any page with `<style>` tags on them. If you are working on a large brew you should notice *significant* performance improvements\r\n- Edit page saving interface has been improved significantly. Auto-saves after 3 seconds on inactivity, now allows user to save at anytime. Will stop the tab from closing witha  pop-up if there are unsaved changes.\r\n- Navbar and overall style has been improved and spacing made more consistent\r\n- Elements under the hood are way more organized and should behaviour much more reliably in many sizes.\r\n- Source now opens to it's own route `/source/:sharedId` instead of just a window. Now easier to share, and won't be blocked by some browsers.\r\n- Print page now auto-opens print dialog. If you want to share your print page link, just remove the `?dialog=true` parameter and it won't open the dialog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 20/04/2016\r\n- A lot of admin improvements. Pagninated brew table\r\n- Added a searching and removing abandoned brew api endpoints (turns out about 40% of brews are shorter that a tweet!).\r\n- Fixed the require cache being cleared. Pages should render a bit faster now.\r\n- Pulled in `kkragenbrink`s fix for nested lists, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 06/04/2016 - v1.4\r\n* Pages will now partially render. This should greatly speed up *very* large homebrews. The Homebreery will figure out which page you should be looking at and render that page, the page before, and the page after.\r\n* Zooming should be fixed. I've changed the font size units to be cm, which match the units of the page. Zooming in and out now look much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Monday, 29/02/2016 - v1.3.1\r\n* Removng the changelog button from the Share page\r\n* Added a A4 page size snippet (thanks \tguppy42!)\r\n* Added support for `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags (thanks crashinworld14!)\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 20/02/2016\r\n* Fixed h1 headers not going full width (thanks McToomin27)\r\n* Added a github issue template\r\n\r\n## v1.3.0\r\n\r\n### Friday, 19/02/2016\r\n* Improved the admin panel\r\n* Added ability to clear away old empty brews\r\n* Added delete button to the edit page\r\n* Added a dynamically updating changelog page! Nifty!\r\n* Added stlying for wide monster stat blocks and single column class tables\r\n* Added snippets for wide monster stat blocks and single column class tables\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 16/02/2016\r\n* Paragraphs right after tables now indent (thanks LikeAJi6!)\r\n* Added a `@page` css rule to auto turn off margins when printing\r\n* Added a `page-break` property on each `.phb` page to properly page the pages up when exporting (thanks Jokefury!)\r\n* Improved first character rendering on Firefox\r\n* Improved table spacing a bit\r\n* Changed padding at page bottom for better fit and clipping of elements\r\n* Improved spacing for bold text (thanks nickpunt!)\r\n\r\n\r\n## v1.2.0\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 17/01/2016\r\n* Added a printer friendly snippet that injects some CSS to remove backbrounds and images\r\n* Adjusted the styling specific to spell blocks to give it tighter spacing\r\n* Added a changelog! How meta!\r\n\r\n## v1.1.0\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 14/01/2016\r\n* Added view source to see the markdown that made the page\r\n* Added print view\r\n* Fixed API issues that were causing the server to crash\r\n* Increased padding on table cells\r\n* Raw html now shows in view source\r\n\r\n\r\n## v1.0.0 - Release\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 3/01/2016\r\n\r\n* Added `phb.standalone.css` plus a build system for creating it\r\n* Added page numbers and footer text\r\n* Page accent now flips each page\r\n\r\n","brew":{"views":0,"lastViewed":"2016-01-25T10:31:47.074Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-14T13:23:11.364Z","createdAt":"2016-01-25T10:31:47.074Z","published":false,"authors":[],"systems":[],"tags":"","description":"","text":"# Aasimar\n___\n\n* <a href=\"#features\">Special feature</a>\n* <a href=\"#appearance\">Special appearance</a>\n* <a href=\"#classOptions\">Aasimar class options</a>\n\n<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>\n\nAasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens.They are descended from beings with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.\n___\nNot all aasimar are descended from humans. Aasimar can be born of any intelligent race, though human aasimar are the most common. Aasimar of other races usually exemplify the ideals of beauty and skill as seen by their base race. For example, halfling aasimar are small, beautifully proportioned, and display exceptional grace. Half-orc aasimar are slightly larger and stronger than ordinary orcs, with tough skin and metallic claws and tusks; they are likely to be neutral rather than evil, but still display aggression and incredible combat prowess. Less common humanoids, such as lizardfolk, catfolk, tengus, and others, can also produce aasimar, though given these races' exotic appearance, members of the more common races may have trouble telling such aasimar apart from their kin.\n\n### Celestial Champions\nAasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.\n___\nEach aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.\n\n### Hidden Wanderers\nWhile aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.\n___\nWhen traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.\n\n```\n```\n\n### Aasimar Guides\nAn aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. \n___\nThe angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.\n___\nA deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva\nmight not understand the compromises and hard choices\nthat mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva,\nan aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high,\nsometimes inflexible standards.\n___\nAs part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.\n\n<div style='column-count:2'>\n| d6  | Name        |\n|:---:|:------------|\n|  1  | Tadriel     |\n|  2  | Myllandra   |\n|  3  | Seraphina   |\n|  4  | Galladia    |\n|  5  | Mykiel      |\n|  6  | Valandras   |\n\n```\n```\n\n| d6  | Nature      |\n|:---:|:------------|\n|  1  | Bookish and lecturing      |\n|  2  | Compassionate and hopeful  |\n|  3  | Practical and lighthearted |\n|  4  | Fierce and vengeful        |\n|  5  | Stern and judgmental       |\n|  6  | Kind and parental          |\n</div>\n\n<img src='http://shatteredspheres.wdfiles.com/local--files/aasimar/Aasimar%20couple-1.jpg' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;right:50px;height:40%;width:40%;' />\n\n\\page\n\n### Conflicted Souls\nDespite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.\n___\nEvil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible.\n\n### Aasimar Names\nMost aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture. \n\n## Aasimar Racial traits\nAasimar share certain racial traits as a result of their celestial descent.\n___\n**Ability Score Increase**. Charisma score increases by 2. \n___\n**Age**. Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.\n___\n**Alignment**. Imbued with celestial power, most aasimar\nare good. Outcast aasimar are most often neutral or\neven evil. \n___\n**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n___\n**Darkvision**. Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n___\n**Celestial Resistance**. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.\n___\n**Aasimar racial ability**. Roll twice on the <a href=\"#features\">special feature</a> and <a href=\"#appearance\">special appearance</a> tables below.\n___\n**Language**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial. \n___\n**Subrace**. Three subraces of aasimar exist: protector aasimar, scourge aasimar, and fallen aasimar. Choose one of them for your character. \n\n```\n```\n\n### Protector Aasimar\nProtector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wher,ever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.\n___\n**Ability Score Increase**. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n___\n**Radiant Soul**. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself,causing your eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from your back.\n\nYour transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level.\n\nOnce you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. \n\n### Scourge Aasimar\nScourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.\n___\n**Ability Score Increase**. Constitution score increases by 1.\n___\n**Radiant Consumption**. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you.\n\nYour transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. \n\nOnce you use this trait, you can't use it again until you\nfinish a long rest.\n\n\\page\n\n### Fallen Aasimar\nAn aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen-a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.\n___\n**Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 1.\n___\n**Necrotic Shroud**. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n\nYour transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage\nequals your level.\n\nOnce you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n<img src='http://duralans-workbench.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-prelude/Alhrand.png' style='position:absolute;top:50px;right:140px;height:30%;' />\n\n## <a name=\"appearance\">Aasimar special appearance</a>\n| d50 | Appearance |\n|:----:|:-------------|\n| 1 | Build: appear sculpted from marble |\n| 2 | Build: slender |\n| 3 | Build: unusually tall |\n| 4 | Build: beautifully proportioned |\n| 5 | Build: graceful |\n| 6 | Build: unusually light |\n| 7 | Build: well-muscled |\n| 8 | Digits: extra long |\n| 9 | Digits: unusually colored nails |\n| 10 | Ears: pointed |\n| 11 | Eyes: catlike |\n| 12 | Eyes: iridescent |\n| 13 | Eyes: glowing |\n| 14 | Face: baby-faced |\n| 15 | Face: perfectly symmetrical |\n| 16 | Face: unearthly beauty |\n| 17 | Hair: animated |\n| 18 | Hair: heatless flames |\n| 19 | Hair: metallic |\n| 20 | Hair: turns silver in moonlight |\n| 21 | Hands: always cool and dry |\n| 22 | Hands: glowing palms |\n| 23 | Hands: leave contrails |\n| 24 | Hands: fingerprints look like holy symbols |\n| 25 | Head: bald |\n| 26 | Shadow: animated |\n\n<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>\n<div style='margin-top:380px'></div>\n\n| d50 | Appearance |\n|:----:|:-------------|\n| 27 | Shadow: bright |\n| 28 | Shadow: winged |\n| 29 | Skin: ashen |\n| 30 | Skin: glittering |\n| 31 | Skin: unusual hue |\n| 32 | Voice: echoes dramatically |\n| 33 | Voice: musical |\n| 34 | Voice: unusually high |\n| 35 | Voice: unusually low |\n| 36 | Voice: words you speak aloud seem to be heard mentally |\n| 37 | Other: always look clean |\n| 38 | Other: always well lit |\n| 39 | Other: androgynous |\n| 40 | Other: breathing sounds like ocean waves |\n| 41 | Other: clothing billows even without wind |\n| 42 | Other: don't sweat |\n| 43 | Other: floral breath |\n| 44 | Other: melodic laugh |\n| 45 | Other: no body hair |\n| 46 | Other: sacred birthmark |\n| 47 | Other: sweet scent |\n| 48 | Other: trance-like sleep |\n| 49 | Other: unusual temperature |\n| 50 | Roll twice more on this table |\n\n\\page\n\n## <a name=\"features\">Aasimar Special Feature</a>\nMany aasimar have unique abilites. Roll 2 random.\n\n| d12 | Special Feature |\n|:----:|:-------------|\n| 1 | You can drink a flask of holy water to heal 1d6 hit points. |\n| 2 | Once you've reached adulthood, you never appear to age, although you take aging penalties normally and die when it is your time. |\n| 3 | If you stand atop a grave and meditate for 10 minutes, you learn the name of whoever lies buried below. |\n| 4 | You feel sick to your stomach when you first come within 30 feet of a fiend. This gives you the poisoned condition, lasting 1 minute. You cannot be affected again for 10 minutes. |\n| 5 | If you die, your body can never be reanimated as an undead creature. |\n| 6 | Your tears are iridescent or glowing, and have the ability to cure disease. This functions as the *lesser restoration* spell. You can use this trait once per day |\n| 7 | Your skin has almost a metallic sheen and allows you to gain sustenance from sunlight. Standing in direct sunlight for half an hour nourishes you as though you had just eaten a hearty meal. You still need to drink water. |\n| 8 | If your body is placed on consecrated ground and prayers to your deity are recited continuously for 24 hours, you return to life as if by a *raise dead* spell. This ability works 1d4 times in your lifetime. |\n| 9 | Your kiss invigorates others. Once per day, you can kiss a creature to reduce its exhaustion level by one, as if you had cast a *greater restoration*. |\n| 10 | You can subsist entirely on honey and wine. |\n| 11 | *Healing Hands*: As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. |\n| 12 | *Light Bearer*: You know the *light* cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.  |\n\n```\n```\n\n## <a name=\"classOptions\">Aasimar Class Options</a>\nAasimar approach some classes is a bit different than other races. When you select one of these classes, it is modified as follows:\n\n#### Barbarian\nWhen you reach 0 hp, you still make death saves, but do not fall unconscious until you fail your first death save. \n\n#### Bard\nYou can sing for 10 minutes to put any number of willing creatures to sleep. Any creature that falls asleep to the sound of your song is protected from nightmare and similar spells and effects affecting dreams for the duration of its rest. You regain the use of this ability after a long rest.\n\n#### Cleric\nIf you have the *light* cantrip, you can manifest it as a halo centered above your head. Once while manifesting this halo, you can choose to have advantage on an charisma ability check. You regain the use of this ability after a long rest.\n\n#### Druid\nNon-magical insects never bite or sting you unless magically compelled to do so.\n\n#### Paladin\nYou gain the following trait. \n\n**Immortal Spark**. An aasimar paladin is usually more driven than their human counterpart. Fighting evil is in their blood. You must fail four death saves before dying.\n\n#### Sorcerer\nYou can spend a sorcery point to consecrate a spell that deals fire damage. If you do, half of the fire damage is instead radiant damage.\n\n","title":"","shareId":"Vkmnu1JKl"}}), document.getElementById("reactContainer"));</script>
